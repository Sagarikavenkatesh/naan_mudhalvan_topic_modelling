 Project Title: *Topic Modelling on The Indian Express Newspaper

This project aims to automatically discover and analyze hidden thematic structures in news articles from *The Indian Express* by applying topic modeling techniques. The core idea is to fetch live news data through RSS feeds, clean and preprocess the text using NLP, and then apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify major discussion themes (topics) present in the news. This helps in summarizing large volumes of news content, understanding prevalent issues, and uncovering trends in Indian journalism.

Packages used:

* feedparser: to fetch RSS news feeds.
* nltk: for natural language preprocessing like stopwords removal and lemmatization.
* spacy: for efficient tokenization and lemmatization.
* gensim: to build the topic modeling (LDA) model.
* re and `pprint`: for text cleaning and structured output display.
